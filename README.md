# Django Sage Encrypt

The django-sage-encrypt is a package based on Django Web Framework & PostgreSQL for the database at rest encryption. Consider that a company can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on firewalls, intrusion detection systems and encryption, and other security technologies still if an attacker can call one trusted person within the company. That person complies, and if the attacker gets in, then all that money spent on technology is essentially wasted (Kevin Mitnick).

Data encryption essentially translates data into a secret code so that only people with access to a decryption key or specific password can read it. Encrypted data is called ciphertext, and unencrypted data is called plaintext. Currently, encryption is one of the most common data security methods that organizations use â€” and for a good reason. Encryption is a crucial step in cybersecurity because it allows organizations and individuals to protect sensitive information and resources.

You can easily encrypt your data in the database using the introduced Django package (django-sage-encrypt). Also, the encryption model is done in such a way that you can efficiently perform search and filtering operations. As you know, this process can be cumbersome and expensive. But because the encryption operation in this package takes place at the SQL level, you do not pay much for data processing.

## Project Detail

You can find all technologies we used in our project into these files:
* Version: 1.0.0
* Frameworks: 
  - Django 3.2.4
* Database:
  - PostgreSQL 10
* Language: Python 3.9.4

## Installation
First install package
```shell
$ pip install django-sage-encrypt
```
Then add 'sage_encrypt' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
  ...
  'sage_encrypt',
  ...
]
```

Also you need to install `pgcrypto` extension in your database:
```shell
sudo -u postgres psql <db_name>
```
```postgresql
CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
```

## Fields
For encrypting each row of your database there are multiple ways:

1. use `encrypt_field` function in your models.py

```python
from django.db import models
from sage_encrypt.services.encrypt import encrypt_field

# symmetric encryption
title = encrypt_field(models.CharField(max_length=255))

# asymmetric encryption
title = encrypt_field(models.CharField(max_length=255), algorithm='asymmetric')
```

2. use field directly

```python
# symmetric encryption
from sage_encrypt.fields.symmetric import EncryptedCharField

title = EncryptedCharField(max_length=255)


# asymmetric encryption
from sage_encrypt.fields.asymmetric import EncryptedCharField

title = EncryptedCharField(max_length=255)
```

If you want to use `symmetric encryption` you don't need to generate secret keys default is SECRET_KEY

But if you want to use `asymmetric encryption` you have to generate private key & public key

## Generate secret key

```shell
# generate private & public key
gpg --gen-key # in password section do not enter password

gpg --list-keys
# output
pub   rsa3072 2021-06-20 [SC] [expires: 2023-06-20]
      <test_token_generated>
uid           [ultimate] Test <test@gmail.com>
sub   rsa3072 2021-06-20 [E] [expires: 2023-06-20]

gpg -a --export <test_token_generated> > public.key
gpg -a --export-secret-keys <test_token_generated> > private.key
```

## Settings

Here are the parameters that you can set from setting:

| Parameter                     | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| ENCRYPT_KEY                   | Secret key that using for symmetric encryption. default: SECRET_KEY              |
| ENCRYPT_PRIVATE_KEY           | Private key for asymmetric encryption. default: None                             |
| ENCRYPT_PUBLIC_KEY            | Private key for asymmetric encryption. default: None                             |

## Management Commands

sage_encrypt provides 2 management commands:

1. `encryptdb`

```shell
python manage.py encryptdb --table <table_name> --column <col_name> --cast <field_previous_cast_type> --algorithm <algorithm> #(symmetric/asymmetric) 
```

Options:

 1. --database (if you have multiple db's specify for your database)
 2. --table (table name in your database not django model title)
 3. --column (col name in the specified table)
 4. --algorithm (symmetric/asymmetric)
 5. --cast (field previous cast that you want to encrypt from that)

Usage:

 When you want to add encryption on a row and there is valuable data in you db, you can encrypt the data to be compatible with Encrypted Field.

2. `decryptdb`

```shell
python manage.py decryptdb --table <table_name> --column <col_name>
```

Options:

 1. --database (if you have multiple db's specify for your database)
 2. --table (table name in your database not django model title)
 3. --column (col name in the specified table)

Usage:

 When your data is encrypted in db, and you want to remove encryption from a row, for getting back data you can use this command, it decrypts data and replaces in your db.
